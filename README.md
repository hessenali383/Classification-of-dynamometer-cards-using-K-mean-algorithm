# Classification-of-dynamometer-cards-using-K-mean-algorithm
A Machine learning project focused on classifying dynamometer cards using the K-means clustering algorithm. The project ingests data from .dat files, extracts relevant information such as timestamps, well names, load, and displacement data. It then preprocesses this data, scales it using StandardScaler, and applies K-means clustering to group the dynamometer cards into distinct clusters based on their load and displacement characteristics. The project also includes an "elbow method" analysis to determine an appropriate number of clusters. Finally, it visualizes the clustered data by plotting load vs. displacement curves for each cluster, allowing for visual inspection and analysis of the different dynamometer card patterns. The overall goal is to identify and categorize different types of dynamometer card behaviors in an unsupervised manner.
